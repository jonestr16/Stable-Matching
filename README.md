# Stable-Matching

To use the stableMatching program, the command line should be divided as such:

stableMatching <The men preference text file> <The girls preference text file> <The name of the file you wish to write to?
Ex. java stableMatching boys.txt girls.txt final.txt 

The program prints off what is going on in the algorithm, and each man or woman is represented by their number value minus 1, but it 
printed back into the last file in the command line as their original reference number.
